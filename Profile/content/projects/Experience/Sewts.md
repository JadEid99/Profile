description: Software & Robotics Engineer || Automated Deformable Material Handling
ProjectDescription: "Sewts's primary product, VELUM, reshaped the automated handling of deformable materials and textiles. The in-house computer vision software analyzed a bin of textiles and fed 3D coordinates to industrial robots that allowed for textile manipulation and processing. This allowed us to further automate the processing of textiles in industrial laundries."
Accomplishments1: Increased system output by approximately 40% by optimizing computer vision software, robot motion planning, and system design.
Accomplishments2: Concluded the development of the first iteration of the VELUM product and began deployment to customers and industrial laundries. 
Accomplishments3: Cooperated with interdisciplinary teams to help design and develop software and hardware for our automation solution. 
Methods1: Contributed to process and system design through rapid prototyping, 3D modeling in SolidWorks & 3D printing, iterative optimization, and cross-functional collaboration.
Methods2: Developed, containerized, and deployed the computer vision code through Python, Docker, and a Linux-based remote deployment solution (Balena OS). 
Methods3: Orchestrated continuous testing in an Agile environment while actively engaging with and presenting results/updates to developers, managers, customers, and other stakeholders.
